Built a 6 degree-of-freedom VR headset (both hardware and software). Worked closely with Prof. Aditya Sankar at the University of Washington Reality Lab, and modeling off Stanford course EE267. I implemented the graphics pipeline in Three.JS (transformations, lighting/shaders, stereo rendering), orientation tracking using the gyroscope and magnetic sensor for drift correction, and SteamVR pose tracking.
