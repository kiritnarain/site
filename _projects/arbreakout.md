In the 24 hour Hack'20 Hackathon, lead a team of 2 others to make remote working with small groups feel more physically present. AR Breakout Rooms uses ARCore and ARKit to bring the avatars of your friends, family and co-workers right in the same space and enables face-to-face talking and sharing 3D content.
