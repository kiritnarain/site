I created a beamsplitter-based Augmented Reality Headset from scratch. The goal of this headset was to create all-day wearable AR glasses focusing on reducing the amount of environmental darkening. The glasses consisted of a 1.28 inch 240x250 LCD display driven by a Raspberry Pi Zero. The image was collimated through a 3.4cm diamater, ~4cm focus convex lens and then reflected into the eye using 10:90 beamsplitter. I designed and modelled the frame in Autodesk Fusion 360 and 3D printed it. I wrote the software platform in C++ and ported LittlevGL to drive the display's framebuffer.
