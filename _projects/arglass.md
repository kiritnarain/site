I built beamsplitter-based Augmented Reality glasses from scratch. The goal of this headset was to create voice controlled, all-day wearable AR glasses with maximal clarity. The glasses consist of a 240x240 SPI LCD display driven by a Raspberry Pi Zero, and the image is collimated through a convex lens and then reflected into the eye using a beamsplitter (~30deg FOV). I designed and modelled the frame in Fusion 360 and 3D printed it. The software stack was largely written in C and Python, using Qt as a UI library.
